# GitWorkshop

Welcome to the first Git and GitHub Workshop!
Some of the information we plan on covering through these sessions includes branches and switching between them, local vs. remote repositories, adding and commiting changes, looking at the aforementioned changes we have made, merge conflicts and the implementation of GUI tools to make this all a bit easier.
